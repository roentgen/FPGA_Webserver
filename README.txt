I'm slowly building a hardware-based web server.

Feel free to look around, but it is not yet anywhere near working

Status
======
* ARP works at Gigabit speeds
* ICMP is working at Gigabit speeds
* UDP RX works

TODO LIST OF MINOR ISSUES THAT I DON'T WANT TO FORGET
=====================================================
Inbound packets
---------------
* Inbound packet reception errors should cause the packet to be dropped.
  Currently this is being done in the individual protocol handlers.

* Inbound packet CRC verification is not being performed - should cause 
  packet to dropped

* Inbound packet MAC filtering not coded - should only accept packets 
  for 'our_mac' or the broadcast MAC. This could be handled the same as 
  CRC or reception errors (where  the FIFO can be rolled back)

UDP Support
-----------
* Only reception of packets is currently coded.
* IP Checksum is not being validated
* UDP Checksum is not being validated
* A UDP packet with no data will not result in anything that the 
  consuming design can see (not a bug, a feature?)

ICMP Support
------------
* ICMP 'echo request' is not validating that the IP checksum is correct
* ICMP 'echo request' is not validating that the ICMP length field is correct.
* ICMP 'echo request' is not validating that the ICMP checksum is correct

Outbound packets
----------------
* Outbound packets are not being sent correctly for 10 & 100Mbps speed. 
  This requies a 4k FIFO, which will block the arbiter when less than 
  1600 entries are free (enough for a packet and some loop latency)
